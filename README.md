Your project, Medical Diagnosis Using AI, utilizes machine learning models to predict diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, thyroid issues, and more. 
It is built using Python, Streamlit for the frontend, and trained models stored as .sav files. The dataset includes various medical records for training and testing.

Features:
    User-friendly interface for disease prediction
    Pre-trained machine learning models for accuracy
    Supports multiple diseases
    Integrated with Streamlit for interactive diagnosis

    
How to Use:
    Run app.py (streamlit run app.py)
    Enter patient details and get predictions
  
Future Enhancements:
    Improve model accuracy with more data
    Add explainable AI for better insights
    Expand to more diseases
